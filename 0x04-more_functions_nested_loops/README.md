## Description

This directory contains various files demonstrating more functions and nested loops in C programming. Each file focuses on a specific concept or task, such as character checks, multiplication, printing numbers, drawing shapes, and more.

## File Descriptions

- [0-isupper.c](./0-isupper.c): Function that checks if a character is uppercase.
- [1-isdigit.c](./1-isdigit.c): Function that checks if a character is a digit.
- [2-mul.c](./2-mul.c): Function that multiplies two integers.
- [3-print_numbers.c](./3-print_numbers.c): Function that prints numbers from 0 to 9.
- [4-print_most_numbers.c](./4-print_most_numbers.c): Function that prints numbers from 0 to 9 except 2 and 4.
- [5-more_numbers.c](./5-more_numbers.c): Function that prints numbers from 0 to 14 ten times.
- [6-print_line.c](./6-print_line.c): Function that draws a straight line using the character `_`.
- [7-print_diagonal.c](./7-print_diagonal.c): Function that draws a diagonal line using the character `\`.
- [8-print_square.c](./8-print_square.c): Function that prints a square using the character `#`.
- [9-fizz_buzz.c](./9-fizz_buzz.c): Program that prints numbers from 1 to 100, but replaces multiples of 3 with "Fizz," multiples of 5 with "Buzz," and multiples of both 3 and 5 with "FizzBuzz."
- [10-print_triangle.c](./10-print_triangle.c): Function that prints a triangle of a given size using the character `#`.
- [100-prime_factor.c](./100-prime_factor.c): Program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of a given number.
- [101-print_number.c](./101-print_number.c): Function that prints an integer.
