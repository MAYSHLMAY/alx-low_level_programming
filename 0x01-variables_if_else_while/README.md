## 📂 Contents

The repository contains the following files:

1. `0-positive_or_negative.c`: This program generates a random number and determines whether it is positive, negative, or zero.
2. `1-last_digit.c`: This program prints the last digit of a given number.
3. `2-print_alphabet.c`: This program prints the lowercase alphabet using a while loop.
4. `3-print_alphabets.c`: This program prints both the lowercase and uppercase alphabets using a while loop.
5. `4-print_alphabt.c`: This program prints the lowercase alphabet excluding the letters 'q' and 'e'.
6. `5-print_numbers.c`: This program prints single-digit numbers using a while loop.
7. `6-print_numberz.c`: This program prints single-digit numbers using a while loop and the `putchar` function.
8. `7-print_tebahpla.c`: This program prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse order using a while loop.
9. `8-print_base16.c`: This program prints all the digits of base 16 (hexadecimal) using a while loop.
10. `9-print_comb.c`: This program prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers using a while loop.

## 🚀 Usage

To compile and run any of the programs, use a C compiler such as GCC. Open your console and navigate to the directory containing the program file, then execute the following commands:

```shell
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic <filename.c> -o <output_file>
./<output_file>

Make sure you have GCC installed on your system and that you are in the correct directory before running the commands.
