# 0x07-pointers_arrays_strings

## Description

This project contains various C source code files related to pointers, arrays, and strings.

## Projects

1. 0-memset.c: This project demonstrates the implementation of the `memset` function in C, which allows you to set a block of memory to a specific value.
2. 101-crackme_password: This project involves cracking a password by analyzing its source code and finding the correct input.
3. 2-strchr.c: This project focuses on implementing the `strchr` function in C, which searches for a specific character in a given string.
4. 4-strpbrk.c: This project demonstrates the implementation of the `strpbrk` function in C, which finds the first occurrence of any character from a set of characters in a given string.
5. 7-print_chessboard.c: This project involves printing a chessboard pattern using characters and arrays in C.
6. main.h: This header file contains function prototypes and declarations used in the other source code files of this project.
7. README.md: This file provides information about the project and its components.
8. 100-set_string.c: This project demonstrates how to change the value of a pointer to a string in C.
9. 1-memcpy.c: This project focuses on implementing the `memcpy` function in C, which copies a block of memory from one location to another.
10. 3-strspn.c: This project involves implementing the `strspn` function in C, which calculates the length of the initial segment of a string that consists of only certain characters.
11. 5-strstr.c: This project demonstrates the implementation of the `strstr` function in C, which finds the first occurrence of a substring in a given string.
12. 8-print_diagsums.c: This project involves printing the sums of the two diagonals of a square matrix in C.
13. _putchar.c: This file contains the implementation of the `_putchar` function, which is used to print characters to the standard output.
